# Q_factor_Nanophotonic_Resonator

## Description
A nanophotonic resonator with high Q-factor and low mode volume is a promising system for creating optoelectronic devices on a chip and enhancing the light-matter interaction. In this work, the parameters of a silicon nitride nanophotonic resonator have been optimized to generate high-quality resonant states. The calculations were carried out using a deterministic method of achieving high Q-factor values.
